Create a function, tipCalculator(), that has two parameters, a string representing the quality of the service received and a number representing the total cost.

Return the tip, as a number, based on the following:
‘bad’ should return a 5% tip
‘ok’ should return a 15% tip
‘good’ should return a 20% tip
‘excellent’ should return a 30% tip
all other inputs should default to 18%

tipCalculator('good', 100) // Should return 20
