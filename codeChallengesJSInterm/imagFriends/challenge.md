A personâ€™s number of imaginary friends are always 33% of their total friends.

Write a function, numImaginaryFriends(), that takes in the total number of friends a person has and returns the number of imaginary friends they have.

Since friends can only come in whole numbers, be sure to round your result before returning it.

The JavaScript Math.round() function will come in handy. Check out the documentation to figure out how it works.
